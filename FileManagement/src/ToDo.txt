Everything:
	- Make sure to have comments on all code specifically once it is fully operational
	- Make sure all code is clean and easy to follow along
	- Add javadocs

Encryption:
	- Maybe make it so that there is more encryption types and different levels of security
	- Make sure that you can not just open the resulting file and read the password

EnhancedJarArchive:
	- There are a lot of ways for the program to crash through this class please add the data validation
	- Multiple input files is working make sure it has the correct functionality
	- Test to make sure the Jar Archiver has all the same functionality as the zipper
	
EnhancedZipper:
	- Make sure that all of the methods are infallible and all exceptions are caught
	- Test the functionality of adding multiple input files and check all the exceptions and such
	- In the _CreateZipFile method there has got to be a better way of checking if there are duplicate file entries
	
GenericFileIO:
	- I would like to add more functionality to this class or maybe even break a bunch of things up into more specific classes
	
HexFileReader:
	- Maybe some functionality so that I can choose offsets of the file that I want to read in
	- Change it to none static methods
	
HiddenMessageReader:
	- Clean up the code and definitely put comments in
	- Make it so that I could possibly read out different things other then strings
		- I don't know if it would be helpful or even have any use
		- But maybe something like reading in a message of numbers or something?
	- Other file types?
	
HiddenMessageWriter:
	- Maybe make the two methods that hide the message in a picture use one common method to
	clean up some of the code and shorten the length of the file
	- Make the messages capable of taking multiple types of objects
	- Other file types?
	- I can't make a new png file figure out why
	- Hide other files inside a picture??
	
JarArchiver:
	- Make sure it works
	- Maybe add the ability to use data encryption

Zipper:
	- Make sure it works
	- Maybe add the ability to use data encryption
